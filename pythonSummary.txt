In the python course we learnt the basics of programming, conditional statements, loops, and containers such as lists and dictionaries. We then learnt about functions and the basics of object oriented programming including classes, objects, constructors, and inheritance. We also learned about modules and packages and how there are many pre-built modules and packages in python 3. Afterwards we worked on 3 different projects. In the first one we wrote a simple python program to process a large number of excel sheets. We then wrote a program to explore machine learning using python. Finally we made a simple shopping website using a python framework known as Django.
