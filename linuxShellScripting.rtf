\f0\fs24 \cf0 Throughout the course we learned how to write and execute shell scripts. We first started by creating a shell script and then giving it executable permissions by running the chmod command. We learned about how to work with file paths to access our scripts. We then learned about variables and how we can use them to format strings to display information using the echo command. Variables are case sensitive and can have their value reassigned. (#) can be used to write comments to help other reading your script. We finished the course by learning about a few more commands such as hostname, uname, df and the flags associated with them. We also learned about comparison operators such as eq,gt,ge,lt,le.}
