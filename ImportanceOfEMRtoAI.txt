Medical Big data such as those stored in electronic medical records has allowed the idea of using artificial intelligence to become a key technological advancement of many hospitals. EMRs contain lots a valuable information about a patients health, such the patients history, diagnosis, test, medications, family history, etc. Using this information along with machine learning technique and artificial intelligence can prove extremely beneficial to the healthcare sector. Artificial intelligence can assist in drug development, personalized healthcare, and an overall increase in the quality of healthcare. AI research using EMR has already shown promising results in predicting diseases such as diabetes, predicting cardiac arrests, and even predicting the risk of hypertension. Many countries, such as the USA have started to implement policies that promote the use of EMR data. However, while the use of EMR with AI holds unlimited potential, concerns such as privacy and data regulations must be carefully considered.Other difficulties, such as the presence of data in EMRs using natural language and abbreviations, as well as the requirement to standardize EMRs to a common format, may prove challenging. However, over time, these challenges are expected to be resolved.All in all, the use of EMR in medical field is rapidly increasing and using AI with the EMR data can allow the healthcare field to improve by leaps and bounds.
